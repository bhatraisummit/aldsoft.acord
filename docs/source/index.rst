Welcome to Aldsoft ACORD's documentation!
=========================================

Aldsoft ACORD is a library that helps serialize and deserialize the ACORD LA XML standard.
The library follows the ACORD XML Schema, and if it doesn't deserialize your text, then
the text you received doesn't follow the ACORD XML Schema! The library also provides a
helpful semi-Fluent API for constructing the ACORD XML Object programatically.
